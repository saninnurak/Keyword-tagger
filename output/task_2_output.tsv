I didn’t make this mistake YOU did!  Now I’m supposed to be the one going through all of this shit??  I don’t think so, I suggest that YOU send one of YOUR employees to the local office and get this resolved & immediately mail MY title to ME!

The two women I spoke to about the issue assured me that the issue would be taken care of with the back bank and that I should see the amount in my bank by the end of yesterday. However, it's the next day and I still can't see the amount in my checking account. Just wanted to check on this issue! This happened on 7/19 at 3:34 PM at ATM 000000

Hey, I have Stetson Vestal here. He only has a loan with AIQFinancial. Loan # 000000. He was here on the 1st to make a cash loan payment. While here he set up an ACH to make payments going forward. Although the ACH already pulled from his external account. Now I don't know who helped him set up the ACH here or what they set the start date to, but he is a tad upset that it already came out and he made to payments. He was wondering if he could get one payment back since he wasnt expecting to make two payments.
